    </p>
    <p class="hd1">9.2.Opt Out from Electronic Communications.</p>
    <p>(a) Zeatr Marketing Communications.Where it is in accordance with your marketing preferences, Zeatr may send you electronic communications marketing or advertising the Services themselves or events on the Services, to the extent you have registered
        for the Services or purchased a ticket and/or registration to an event listed on the Services.You can also "opt out" of receiving these electronic communications by clicking on the "Unsubscribe" link at the bottom of any such electronic communication.
        (b) Organiser Initiated Communications.Organisers may use our community group chat options to contact the members who have accepted to be part of the Event, including Attendees who have chosen to follow the Oorganizer’s events.Although these electronic
        communications are sent through our system, Zeatr does not determine the content or the recipients of these electronic communications.Organisers are required to use our chat tool only via the Site.(c) Social Notifications.  If you connect your
        Facebook account or sign up for other social media integrations whose product features include social notifications (i.e., updates on what your friends are doing on the Services), you will receive these social notifications.You can manage these
        social notifications by toggling your social settings to private or disconnecting such integration.  (d) Transactional or Responsive Communications.Certain electronic communications from Zeatr are responsive to your requests.For instance, if you

        any unsubscribe election that you have made, you will still receive these transactional or responsive emails.You can stop receiving these types of emails only by contacting us.By electing to stop receiving all electronic communications from us
        or through our system you will no longer receive any updates on events you have created (including pay-out issues) or on events you are registered to attend (including emails with your tickets).We do not recommend that you do this unless you plan
        to no longer use the Services, are not currently registered for an event, are not currently organising an event and will have no need to receive further communications from us or through our system.
    </p>
    <p class="hd1">9.3 Location tracking Zeatr would need you to accept location tracking for us to display and/or recommend the events specific to your location.</p>
    <p> You may choose not to disclose your location information by disabling the location tracking function but this will limit our ability to personalize information regarding the events which may be applicable and relevant to you.</p>
    <p class="hd">10.Exclusions.</p>
    <p class="hd1">10.1 Personal Data Provided to Others.</p>
